# Bayesian Categorical Data Analysis

This is a set of tools for Bayesian analysis of categorical data, specifically 2×2 contingency tables.

Use:

- `beta_binom()` for analysis using the Beta-Binomial model
  - `print()`, `plot()`, and `summary()` to view the results
  - `update()` if you have additional data
- `est_multinom()` for estimating multinomial cell probabilities

For more information, see the Tutorial vignette.

## Updating the posterior

In Bayesian statistics, we can reuse a previously computed posterior as a prior if we have additional data, allowing us to update the parameter estimates as new data becomes available. Suppose we collect 40 observations from 2 groups (20 per group) on the first day of the A/B test, and 10 observations per day for the next 2 weeks. Here we see what happens when we update the posterior with additional data on a daily basis:
